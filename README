Current tutorial has been completed in this repository.

The folder "finished_src" contains the files that I made changes to by
following the tutorial.

The folder "original_src" contains the files that need SSL added to them
by following the tutorial.

The original "finished_src" folder with outdated cyaSSL implementations has
been overwritten.

The official README from the wolfSSL download of this tutorial is included
below. It is also slightly outdated.
